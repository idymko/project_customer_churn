# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, credit card customers who are most likely to churn are identified. The completed project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package can also be run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI). The best coding practices for testing and logging are implemented.
